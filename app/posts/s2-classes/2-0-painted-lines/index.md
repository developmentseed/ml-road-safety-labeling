Draw a box around the road (the box should cover only the main road) and classify it as `painted_lines` with one of the following options:

- [Center line](../center-line/)
- [Edge line](../edge-line/)
- [Both lines](../both/)
- [None](../none)

## Edge cases
Urban roads have painted lines to indicate the lanes. Consider these case as `painted_lines` and clasify it into `both` type.
